# hello-world
Introductory repository
This is just my first repository to familiarize myself with the GITHUB environment.

My name is Ignacio Gea and I am a computer engineering student at the University of Arkansas. I am originally from Mexico and a few of my hobbies are soccer, guitar, reading the news, space research, and the occasional beer..
